      This is some text in a paragraph element.

      <span>
        This text has been styled bold because it is in a span element
        that's a child of a paragraph element.
       </span>

      <span class="highlight">
        This text is yellow because the class selector overrides
        the tag selector when multiple style declarations apply to the same
        attribute (`color`) of the same element. It's still bold though!
       </span>
